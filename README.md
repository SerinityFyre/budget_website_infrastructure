# budget_website_infrastructure

TODO: Enter the cookbook description here.
* tried and failed 4 or 5 times to align creating GitHub repos and cookbooks before finally hitting on how to do it right
* adding an initial (blank) `budget_website_infrastructure.rb` cookbook
* figured out where recipes actually go in a cookbook, and learnded that the `budget_website_infrastructure.rb` file I created is a recipe and not a cookbook haha
